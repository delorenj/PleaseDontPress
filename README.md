There is really no need to. I promise. Like seriously promise. With sugar and cherries and plutonium on top.

## 🤔 Think about it

Why would I make this app? Why would I spend SO much time - precious time that could have been spent teaching squirrels to waterski or counting individual grains of sand - making this app, just to tell you to not press the button if it really wasn't a big deal? It just doesn't make sense. So I again emplore you to heed my advice because I am knowing the happens when presses are done (of the button)

## ⚖️ Let's weigh outcomes here

I'm an engineer, so I am all about trade-offs. Like trading my sanity for this button. And in this case, there is a clear trade-off: pressing the button vs not pressing the button.

Pressing the button:

- 😱 You get to press the button
- 😔 You might feel good, but this will not last
- 😰 You may regret your choice
- 💀 You certainly will regret your choice
- 🌋 The ancient ones may awaken
- 🧀 Your cheese may spontaneously combust

Not pressing the button:

- 😌 You don't have to deal with button press outcome
- 🌈 You can go about your day as though you have not seen button
- 🎉 You'll be happy that you made a choice that was not buttonpress
- 🦄 Your dreams of becoming a professional unicorn tamer remain intact
- 🥔 Your potatoes stay exactly where you left them

So, really, this does not help your button decision so you may continue deliberation while I go reorganize my collection of vintage dust particles.

## 🎭 Final thoughts

I hope you understand the gravity of my situation and the importance of your decision. I am counting on you to make the right choice. Please sir or madam, do not press. The fate of all breakfast cereals may depend on it.
