# Goal

Let's make the landing page (and only page) of this stupid app.

## Requirements

1. REALLY REALLY big button that say "Please do not press. Please."
2. Page should be divided into a grid of 40x40 squares.
3. For testing purposes (unless it looks reeeeally cool, then i'll keep it), cycle through each square very quickly highlighting the "current" square in a semi-transparent color.
4. The button shouldbe centered on the page and always visible.
